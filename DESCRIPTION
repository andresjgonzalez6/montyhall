Description: This package has 7 functions total. You can simulate
            the Monty Hall Problem, a game show with 3 doors. Behind
            the doors are 2 goats and 1 car. Choose a car door and you
            win a car, choose a goat door and you lose. This package 
            has a simulation function to allow for many iterations 
            to run in a loop. You can view the table of results- are 
            you more likely to win by sticking with your original door,
            or are you more likely to win by switching doors after 
            a goat is revealed?
